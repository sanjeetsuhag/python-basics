## Assignment 4 - Python Basics

1. Write a Python script to accept 3 numbers from a user and print them out in descending order. The output should look exactly as given below:

   ```

2. Write a Python script to accept a number from a user and print out all numbers less than it that are not its factors. The output should look exactly as given below:

   ```
   Enter a number: 12

   Factors of 12:
   5
   7
   8
   9
   10
   11
   ```

3. Write a Python script to accept two numbers and print the one whose factors total to a greater sum. The output should look exactly as given below:

   ```
   Enter the first number: 12
   Enter the second number: 15

   The sum of factors of 12 is 16.
   That is higher than the sum of factors of 15, which is 9.
